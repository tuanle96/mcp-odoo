# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- XML-RPC transport: create the `ServerProxy` clients with `allow_none=True` so a
  call whose payload or `fields_get` metadata contains `None` no longer raises
  `TypeError: cannot marshal None unless allow_none is enabled` (seen when creating
  a `product.pricelist` through `validate_write`). Odoo's XML-RPC server already
  emits `<nil/>`, so the client must accept it too.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-11

The v1.0 milestone: four roadmap phases close the highest-value gaps no
open-source Odoo MCP server covered. Tool count 36 → 39; 854 tests.

### Added
- **Field-level ACL (read-path)** — opt-in, per-instance, per-model field
  allow/deny enforced at a single choke point on every path that returns
  record data: `search_records`, `read_record`, `aggregate_records` (denied
  groupby/measure rejected), `get_model_fields` (denied fields marked
  `"access": "restricted"`, not hidden), `index_knowledge` (denied fields
  excluded before BM25 indexing), and the `odoo://` resources. Responses gain
  a `redacted_fields` note. Configure via a `field_acl` key in the policy
  file or `ODOO_MCP_FIELD_POLICY_FILE`; malformed policy fails closed at
  startup. No policy → byte-identical v0.9.0 behavior. First open-source Odoo
  MCP server with field ACL. New module `field_policy.py`; see
  [docs/field-acl.md](docs/field-acl.md).
- **Cross-instance fan-out (read-only)** — `search_across_instances`,
  `aggregate_across_instances`, and `accounting_health_across_instances` ask
  one question across many configured instances and return merged,
  `_instance`-attributed results with a partial-failure `errors` map. Instance
  selection by list, `"all"`, or `{"tags": [...]}`; opt out per instance with
  `"cross_instance": false`. Each instance is queried under its own field ACL
  (applied before merge), bounded concurrency
  (`ODOO_MCP_CROSS_INSTANCE_WORKERS`, default 4), and its own rate-limit
  budget; large fleets can run via `submit_async_task`. No warehouse, no sync.
  New modules `cross_instance.py` + `tools_cross_instance.py`; see
  [docs/partner-playbook.md](docs/partner-playbook.md).
- **5 operational workflow prompts** (prompt count 5 → 10) —
  `invoice_approval_chain`, `po_to_receipt`, `customer_onboarding`,
  `expense_claim_review`, `accounting_close_checklist`. Each names its
  required modules, the exact tools per step, and human checkpoints; every
  write-bearing step routes through the gated workflow (no ungated writes).
  New module `prompts_workflows.py`.
- **Head-to-head benchmark** — `scripts/benchmark_head_to_head.py` measures
  mcp-odoo against another Odoo MCP server on the same Odoo stack;
  [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md) publishes a reproducible
  methodology and measured numbers (mcp-odoo p50 ~10 ms for common reads on a
  local Odoo 19 stack).
- Config: optional per-instance `tags` and `cross_instance` keys;
  `list_instances` now reports them.

### Changed
- `health_check` runtime posture adds a `field_acl` section (active flag +
  instance count, never policy contents).
- `.importlinter` extended to cover the new core (`field_policy`,
  `cross_instance`) and surface (`tools_cross_instance`, `prompts_workflows`)
  modules; contracts still 2 kept.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Background task tools (tool count 27 → 36 together with the knowledge and accounting tools) — `submit_async_task` runs allowlisted long read operations (`scan_addons_source`, `index_knowledge`, `receivable_payable_aging`) on a bounded thread pool (`ODOO_MCP_ASYNC_MAX_WORKERS`, default 2); poll with `get_async_task`, cancel with `cancel_async_task`, list with `list_async_tasks`. Results are retained in memory with a TTL (`ODOO_MCP_ASYNC_RESULT_TTL`, default 1h) and entry cap (`ODOO_MCP_ASYNC_MAX_TASKS`, default 50). Writes are never accepted on the async path.
- Local-first knowledge search — `index_knowledge` fetches a bounded record slice (smart business-field selection by default) and builds an in-process BM25 index; `search_knowledge` runs accent-insensitive relevance-ranked queries with zero further RPC calls; `knowledge_stats` reports index sizes. Document budget via `ODOO_MCP_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_DOCS` (default 5000). No embeddings service, no new dependencies, no data leaving the machine.
- Accounting domain pack (read-only) — `receivable_payable_aging` buckets open posted items by days overdue (not due / 1-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+) with per-partner totals and a sign-flip for payables; `accounting_health_summary` reports open AR/AP item counts and the draft invoice backlog. Works on Odoo 16+ via `account_type` selections.
- Opt-in tool rate limiting — `ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MODE=warn|block` tracks calls per `instance:tool` in a sliding window (`ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, default 60s; `ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CALLS`, default 120). `warn` only surfaces counters in `health_check.rate_limits`; `block` refuses over-budget calls on `search_records`, `read_record`, `aggregate_records`, and `execute_method` with a structured error. Default `off` preserves existing behaviour.
- Benchmark harness — `scripts/benchmark_tools.py` measures per-tool latency (p50/p95/mean) over MCP stdio against any Odoo instance; methodology and reference numbers in `docs/benchmarks.md`.
- `docs/claude-desktop-connector.md` — expose the server as a Claude Desktop / claude.ai Custom Connector using the existing Streamable HTTP transport and OAuth 2.1 resource server.
- Dedicated unit tests for `tool_helpers`, `access_helpers`, `schema_cache`, and `write_policy` (245 tests), plus suites for the new task queue, rate limiter, knowledge index, and accounting builders. Full suite: 802 tests.

### Changed
- Internal refactor: `server.py` (2,553 lines) split into domain modules — `server_core.py` (FastMCP instance, lifespan, shared infra, resources), `tools_read.py`, `tools_write.py`, `tools_diagnostics.py`, `tools_knowledge.py`, `tools_accounting.py`, `tools_async.py`, and `prompts.py`. `odoo_mcp.server` remains the full public re-export surface; no behavior change and all existing imports/monkeypatch targets keep working.
- `.importlinter` now enforces two real contracts for `odoo_mcp` (core helpers must not import the MCP surface; server → tool modules → core layering) instead of referencing a non-existent package.
- `docs/catalog-submission.md` expanded with Official MCP Registry and Docker MCP Catalog submission checklists plus outreach drafts.
- README setup restructured into a single `Setup` section with two explicit paths: **For humans** (interactive wizard, Claude Desktop, pip/Docker/dev installs) and **For AI agents** (a paste-able self-install prompt, `claude mcp add` one-liners, framework SDK examples). The long environment-variable table moved to a new `Configuration reference` section.
- Added `llms-install.md` — a self-contained, machine-readable installation guide (Cline convention) for AI agents installing the server on a user's behalf, including the configuration contract, per-client steps, verification sequence, and agent security rules (never echo credentials, never enable writes without explicit consent).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Free-text `query` parameter on `search_records` — the server builds an OR `ilike` domain over the model's searchable text fields (identifier columns like `name`, `ref`, `email` first; capped at 5) and ANDs it with any explicit `domain`. Falls back to `name` when field metadata is unavailable. The response reports `query_fields_used`.
- Interactive setup wizard — `odoo-mcp --setup` prompts for connection details, tests the connection, writes an owner-only config file (default `~/.config/odoo/config.json`, auto-discovered by the server), and prints ready-to-paste client snippets (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop).
- `docs/comparison.md` — an honest feature comparison of Odoo MCP bridges (setup, write safety, transports, multi-instance, diagnostics, testing), linked from the README.

### Changed
- Internal refactor: extracted pure helpers from `server.py` (3,053 → ~2,550 lines) into `tool_helpers.py` (validation, domain normalization, request models, version parsing), `schema_cache.py` (BoundedTTLCache), `access_helpers.py` (ACL/record-rule analysis), and `write_policy.py` (write flags + side-effect policy). All names remain importable from `odoo_mcp.server`; no behavior change.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- OAuth 2.1 resource server for HTTP transports — set `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_ISSUER_URL`, `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_INTROSPECTION_URL`, and `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_RESOURCE_URL` to require bearer tokens on Streamable HTTP. Tokens are validated via RFC 7662 introspection (optional client credentials), with an RFC 8707 audience check when the authorization server binds tokens to resources; RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata is served by the MCP SDK. stdio is unaffected; posture appears in `health_check` as `runtime.oauth`.
- Batch create in the gated write workflow — `preview_write`/`validate_write` accept `values_list` (one dict per record, max 100); execution maps to a single atomic Odoo `create(vals_list)` call and the approval token covers the whole batch. Per-record differing `write` values are deliberately rejected (`values_list_unsupported_operation`) because they would require non-atomic per-record RPC calls.
- Added `read_attachment` tool (tool count 26 → 27) — reads `ir.attachment` metadata plus size-capped base64 content (`ODOO_MCP_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`, default 1 MiB, hard cap 16 MiB), with a defensive re-check of the actually fetched payload size and URL-type attachment handling.

### Compatibility
- Approval tokens for single-record writes are unchanged; the canonical payload only gains a `values_list` key when batching is used.
- OAuth is opt-in; without `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_*` env vars the HTTP transport behaves exactly as before.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Framework adapter examples in `examples/` — copy-paste integrations for Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json` + rules), Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenAI Agents SDK (local `MCPServerStreamableHttp` + `HostedMCPTool`), LangGraph (`langchain-mcp-adapters>=0.2.2`), CrewAI (native `mcps=[...]`), and an importable n8n workflow using the official MCP Client Tool node. Index with a transport matrix at `examples/README.md`. Python adapters support any OpenAI-compatible provider via `OPENAI_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_MODEL` and were verified end-to-end against a live Odoo 19 stack (openai-agents 0.17.4, langchain 1.3.6, crewai 1.14.6, n8n 2.25.7 import).
- Audit logging trail — `ODOO_MCP_AUDIT_LOG=<path>` appends one JSONL line per write-path event (`preview`, `validate`, `execute`, `elicit`, `chatter_post`) with model, operation, record IDs, instance, outcome, and a token digest (never the token itself). Fail-open with a warning; posture surfaced in `health_check`.
- Elicitation-based write approval — `ODOO_MCP_ELICIT_WRITES=1` makes `execute_approved_write` ask the human through MCP elicitation (native confirm form showing a diff summary) before executing; clients without elicitation support fall back to the unchanged token flow. Declines are audited.
- Side-effect policy file — reviewed `execute_method` side-effect methods can now live in a version-controllable JSON file (`ODOO_MCP_POLICY_FILE`, default `./odoo_mcp_policy.json` when present; see `odoo_mcp_policy.json.example`) with reviewer metadata, merged with the `ODOO_MCP_ALLOWED_SIDE_EFFECT_METHODS` env allowlist. Broken policy files fail closed and surface their error in `health_check`.
- Reliability hardening — read-only Odoo calls retry connection-level failures with exponential backoff (`ODOO_MCP_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `ODOO_MCP_RETRY_BACKOFF`; writes never retry); the schema cache is now TTL- and LRU-bounded (`ODOO_MCP_SCHEMA_CACHE_TTL`, `ODOO_MCP_SCHEMA_CACHE_MAX`); `health_check` reports models hit by N+1 `read_record` loops (`runtime.n_plus_one`).
- New guides: `docs/troubleshooting.md` (error-classifier categories → fixes), `docs/multi-instance.md`, `docs/performance.md`.

### Compatibility
- No breaking changes. Tool count stays 26; elicitation, audit logging, and the policy file are all opt-in; retry/caching defaults preserve existing behavior envelopes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Added `lookup_model_history` tool — resolves outdated model names against a curated rename catalog (`account.invoice` → `account.move`, `mail.channel` → `discuss.channel`, payment acquirers, analytic tags, chart templates, and more) so agents stop hallucinating pre-rename names. Static catalog shipped at `odoo_mcp/data/odoo_renames.json`; never contacts Odoo.
- Added access-error root-cause classification — `diagnose_access` accepts an `observed_error` argument and `diagnose_odoo_call` reports `error_classification`, mapping Odoo error text to `acl`, `record_rule`, `multi_company`, `authentication`, `db_routing`, or `missing_or_filtered` with a recommended next action.
- Added field-relevance ranking — `get_model_fields` accepts `relevance="top"` and `max_fields` to return only the most business-relevant fields (required/searchable boosted) on wide models like `res.partner`.
- Added `server.json` and a `mcp-registry-publish` release job — the server publishes to the official MCP registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as `io.github.tuanle96/mcp-odoo` via GitHub OIDC after each PyPI release.

### Changed
- Updated the XML-RPC/JSON-RPC removal timeline to Odoo 22 (fall 2028) following Odoo's postponement from Odoo 20. `diagnose_odoo_call` with `transport="xmlrpc"` now warns (instead of blocking) for Odoo 19–21 targets and errors only for Odoo 22+; `upgrade_risk_report` marks `json2_required` from Odoo 22. The `ODOO20_RPC_REMOVAL` constant is deprecated in favor of `ODOO_RPC_REMOVAL`.
- README repositioned around version fluency (16 → 22) instead of the obsolete "survives Odoo 20" framing.

### Compatibility
- Tool count surfaced by `health_check` is now 26 (was 25 in v0.4.0).
- `upgrade_risk_report` with `target_version="20.0"`/`"21.0"` now returns `blocked: false` with a `json2_migration` warning instead of a blocking `xmlrpc_jsonrpc_removal` error.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Multi-instance support — configure several named Odoo instances in one config file via an `instances` map plus a `default` key. Every Odoo-facing tool accepts an optional `instance` parameter (omitted → default instance). Clients connect lazily per instance.
- Added `list_instances` tool — reports configured instance names, URLs, databases, and transports without ever exposing credentials.
- Added `ODOO_CONFIG_FILE` env var — explicit config file path checked before `./odoo_config.json`, `~/.config/odoo/config.json`, and `~/.odoo_config.json`.
- Per-instance `timeout` and `verify_ssl` config keys; global env vars now act as fallback defaults for entries that omit a key.
- `health_check` / `runtime_security_report` now include `odoo_instances` posture (`instance_count`, `default_instance`).
- Added `scripts/odoo_multi_instance_smoke.py` — live Docker Compose smoke for multi-instance: three databases at once, two accounts on one instance, per-instance writes, cross-instance isolation, and token-replay rejection.

### Security
- Write-approval tokens (`preview_write` → `validate_write` → `execute_approved_write`) and `chatter_post` tokens now encode the target instance name. A token validated against one instance can never verify or execute against another. `execute_approved_write` executes on the instance recorded in the approval — there is no instance override at execution time.
- Schema caches (smart-field metadata and `schema_catalog`) are partitioned per instance, so field metadata from one Odoo database is never served for another.
- `execute_approved_write` no longer echoes `expected_token` on a token mismatch — returning the correct token for an arbitrary payload was a token-minting oracle. Re-run `preview_write`/`validate_write` instead.
- Instance config entries never inherit `ODOO_API_KEY` (or any credential) from the environment; a warning is printed when `ODOO_CONFIG_FILE` is set but ignored because all four legacy `ODOO_*` connection env vars are present.

### Compatibility
- No breaking changes. Legacy environment variables (`ODOO_URL`/`ODOO_DB`/`ODOO_USERNAME`/`ODOO_PASSWORD`) and flat `odoo_config.json` files keep working unchanged and still take precedence; they define a single instance named `default`.
- Approval tokens are session-scoped and in-memory, so the token format change requires no migration.
- Tool count surfaced by `health_check` is now 25 (was 24 in v0.3.x).
- MCP resources (`odoo://…`) use the default instance in this release; multi-instance resource URIs are future work.

### Schema Compatibility
- No schema compatibility changes.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Fixed `aggregate_records` on Odoo Online SaaS 19.x by detecting SaaS version metadata such as `saas~19` and routing Odoo 19+ aggregation calls to `formatted_read_group` instead of legacy `read_group`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Added `aggregate_records` tool — server-side groupby/aggregation that uses `formatted_read_group` on Odoo 19+ and falls back to `read_group` on earlier versions. Supports `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `count_distinct`, `array_agg`, `bool_and`, `bool_or`.
- Added `chatter_post` tool — post messages on `mail.thread` records with two safety modes: default approval-token preview/execute flow, or direct mode via `MCP_CHATTER_DIRECT=1`. Supports `message_type` (`comment`/`notification`), `subtype_xmlid`, `partner_ids`, `attachment_ids`.
- Added smart field selection for `search_records` and `read_record` — when the caller omits `fields`, the server picks a curated subset (business identifiers + state + key relations) and excludes audit, message, activity, binary, and unstored-compute columns. Pass `fields=["*"]` to opt out and fetch every field. Cap configured via `ODOO_MCP_MAX_SMART_FIELDS` (default 15).
- Added `ODOO_LOCALE` plumbing — when set, every Odoo call gets `context.lang` injected automatically. Caller-supplied `context.lang` always wins.
- Added structured logging — `setup_logging()` reads `ODOO_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`, `ODOO_MCP_LOG_JSON`, and `ODOO_MCP_LOG_FILE`. JSON formatter and rotating file handler use the standard library only (no new runtime dependencies).
- Surfaced `chatter_direct_enabled` posture in `runtime_security_report` and `health_check`.
- Extended JSON-2 positional argument mappings for `read_group`, `formatted_read_group`, and `message_post`.

### Changed
- `search_records` and `read_record` responses now include `smart_fields_applied` and `fields_used`.
- Tool count surfaced by `health_check` is now 24 (was 22 in v0.2.0).
- `OdooClient.__init__` accepts an optional `lang` argument that drives the locale-injection pipeline.

### Compatibility
- No breaking changes for existing callers. Default behaviour for `search_records` / `read_record` shifts from "all fields" to "smart subset" — pass `fields=["*"]` to restore the prior behaviour.
- New env vars: `ODOO_LOCALE`, `ODOO_MCP_MAX_SMART_FIELDS`, `ODOO_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`, `ODOO_MCP_LOG_JSON`, `ODOO_MCP_LOG_FILE`, `MCP_CHATTER_DIRECT`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added `diagnose_access` to inspect readable ACL, record-rule, current-user, and count evidence for the current Odoo credential without sudo or impersonation.
- Added exact side-effect method allowlisting with `ODOO_MCP_ALLOWED_SIDE_EFFECT_METHODS`.
- Added static addon scanner findings for computed-field `@api.depends` coverage and CRUD override `super()` return contracts.
- Added Docker Compose smoke coverage for a packaged custom addon XML install/update lifecycle and its XML-defined record rule.

### Changed
- Classified common Odoo side-effect methods such as `message_post`, `action_*`, `button_*`, `*_send*`, `*_post*`, and `*_validate*` separately from unknown methods.
- Updated smoke expectations from 21 to 22 MCP tools.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added MCP safety annotations and structured output schemas across the tool surface.
- Added Odoo profile and schema catalog tools for bounded live environment discovery.
- Added safe write workflow tools: `preview_write`, `validate_write`, and fail-closed `execute_approved_write`.
- Hardened safe writes so execution requires a same-process `validate_write` approval record, `confirm=true`, and `ODOO_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=1`.
- Blocked direct `create`/`write`/`unlink` through `execute_method` and blocked unknown side-effect methods unless explicitly trusted with `ODOO_MCP_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_METHODS=1`.
- Restricted explicit addon source scans to configured `ODOO_ADDONS_PATHS` roots.
- Added local addon source scanning, structured domain building, business pack reporting, runtime health, and 5 MCP prompts for agent workflows.

### Changed
- Reworked project documentation for a polished open-source GitHub presentation, including a concise README, client configuration guide, architecture notes, testing guide, contributing guide, security policy, support guide, code of conduct, package metadata URLs, and sdist documentation inclusion.
- Hardened HTTP runtime startup so non-local binds require `--allow-remote-http` or `MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE_HTTP=1`.
- Expanded the Docker Compose smoke harness to require 21 tools, 5 prompts, and live checks for the new agent workflow tools.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added a Docker Compose integration smoke harness that boots disposable Odoo 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, and 19.0 stacks and validates live HTTP, XML-RPC, and MCP stdio behavior.
- Added Odoo 19 External JSON-2 transport support behind `ODOO_TRANSPORT=json2`, with bearer API-key authentication through `ODOO_API_KEY`.
- Added Odoo 19 JSON-2 smoke validation that generates a disposable API key and verifies both direct `/json/2` calls and MCP stdio calls.
- Added opt-in MCP Streamable HTTP and SSE runtime support through `--transport`, `--host`, `--port`, and `--path`.
- Added read-only typed tools: `list_models`, `get_model_fields`, `search_records`, and `read_record`.
- Added diagnostic/report tools for agent workflows: `diagnose_odoo_call`, `inspect_model_relationships`, `generate_json2_payload`, `upgrade_risk_report`, and `fit_gap_report`.
- Added `ODOO_JSON2_DATABASE_HEADER` support so JSON-2 calls send `X-Odoo-Database` by default and can opt out for host/dbfilter-routed deployments.
- Added MCP Inspector smoke validation for `tools/list` over stdio and Streamable HTTP.
- Added generic client configuration examples for stdio, Docker stdio, and Streamable HTTP.

### Changed
- Documented the current compatibility posture for the planned 0.0.4 release: XML-RPC remains the default transport, while Odoo's External JSON-2 API is available for Odoo 19.
- Documented JSON-2 named argument mapping, per-call transaction behavior, Odoo-shaped error preservation, and debug redaction defaults.
- Updated README setup guidance for Claude Desktop on macOS, including the expected config file location and the recommendation to use an absolute Python path.
- Updated Docker usage guidance to build and run the local `mcp/odoo:latest` image with the current Odoo environment variables.
- Clarified the current MCP surface as 12 tools and 4 resource URI patterns, matching the implemented server.
- Updated release workflow intent so PyPI publishing stays behind tests, build, and MCP Inspector runtime smoke validation.

### Notes
- Odoo's current 19.0 documentation source says XML-RPC and JSON-RPC endpoints are deprecated and scheduled for removal in Odoo 20 (fall 2026), with External JSON-2 as the replacement.
- JSON-2 is explicit opt-in. XML-RPC carries the database name per request; JSON-2 uses bearer auth and this server sends `X-Odoo-Database` by default for multi-database deployments.

## [0.0.3] - 2025-03-18

### Fixed
- Fixed `OdooClient` class by adding missing methods: `get_models()`, `get_model_info()`, `get_model_fields()`, `search_read()`, and `read_records()`
- Ensured compatibility with different Odoo versions by using only basic fields when retrieving model information

### Added
- Support for retrieving all models from an Odoo instance
- Support for retrieving detailed information about specific models
- Support for searching and reading records with various filtering options

## [0.0.2] - 2025-03-18

### Fixed
- Added missing dependencies in pyproject.toml: `mcp>=0.1.1`, `requests>=2.31.0`, `xmlrpc>=0.4.1`

## [0.0.1] - 2025-03-18

### Added
- Initial release with basic Odoo XML-RPC client support
- MCP Server integration for Odoo
- Command-line interface for quick setup and testing
