Odoo MCP turns any Odoo 16+ database into a Model Context Protocol server — using only your existing credentials. **No App Store module, no permission setup, no admin access required.** Built for local agents, IDEs, and automation tools that need real Odoo context without hand-rolled scripts or unsafe direct write access.

It speaks XML-RPC for Odoo 16-18 and External JSON-2 for Odoo 19+. It exposes a compact MCP surface with read tools, diagnostics, schema discovery, migration helpers, local addon scanning, and a gated write workflow. One server can serve [multiple named Odoo instances](#multiple-odoo-instances) at once.

## Try it in 30 seconds

Once configured (see [Setup](#setup)), ask your agent things like:

> "Show me all customers from Spain with unpaid invoices."
>
> "Find products with stock below 10 units in the main warehouse."
>
> "Audit the `custom_billing` addon for upgrade risks before we move to Odoo 19."

## Highlights

| Capability | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| 41 MCP tools | Read records and attachments, aggregate server-side, post chatter, inspect schema, build domains, scan addons, diagnose calls and upgrade logs, check data quality, access rules, resolve model renames, validate writes, and fan out across instances. |
| Field-level ACL | Opt-in per-instance, per-model field allow/deny enforced on every read path (records, aggregates, knowledge index, resources). First open-source Odoo MCP with it. See [docs/field-acl.md](docs/field-acl.md). |
| Cross-instance queries | Read-only fan-out across many client DBs with merged, attributed, partial-failure-tolerant results — no warehouse, no sync. See [docs/partner-playbook.md](docs/partner-playbook.md). |
| Workflow prompts | 11 prompts including 6 end-to-end business workflows (invoice approval, PO match, onboarding, expense review, month-end close, pre-migration data quality) that route writes through the gate. |
| Background tasks | `submit_async_task` runs long read operations (addon scans, knowledge indexing, AR/AP aging) on a bounded worker pool; poll with `get_async_task` while the agent keeps reasoning. |
| Local-first knowledge search | `index_knowledge` + `search_knowledge` give BM25 relevance ranking over a bounded record slice — accent-insensitive, in-process, no embeddings service, no data leaving the machine. |
| Accounting pack | `receivable_payable_aging` and `accounting_health_summary` answer the most common finance questions in one call instead of hand-built domains. |
| Agent Skills pack | 4 business-workflow skills (data-quality gate, migration copilot, month-end close, agency fleet review) — `npx skills add tuanle96/mcp-odoo`. Developing on Odoo with shell access? Add the 21-skill companion dev suite [odoo-ai-skills](https://github.com/tuanle96/odoo-ai-skills). See [skills/](./skills/). |
| Tool plugins | Ship your own tools as pip packages (`odoo_mcp.tools` entry points) — opt-in via `ODOO_MCP_PLUGINS`, fail-isolated, no fork needed. Trim the surface per deployment with `ODOO_MCP_TOOLS_INCLUDE/EXCLUDE`. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md). |
| Rate limiting | Opt-in sliding-window budget per instance and tool (`ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MODE=warn\|block`), surfaced in `health_check`. |
| Multi-instance | One server, several named Odoo instances — optional `instance` parameter on every tool, `list_instances` discovery, instance-bound approval tokens, per-instance schema caches. |
| 5 agent prompts | Reusable workflows for failed calls, fit/gap workshops, JSON-2 migration, safe writes, and module audits. |
| Odoo 16-19 coverage | XML-RPC by default, JSON-2 opt-in for Odoo 19. |
| Streamable HTTP | Local HTTP/SSE support for clients that do not use stdio. |
| Smart field selection | `search_records` and `read_record` curate business-relevant fields when no `fields` argument is supplied — drops audit, message, binary, and unstored compute noise. Pass `fields=["*"]` to opt out. |
| Server-side aggregation | `aggregate_records` pushes groupby/sum/count/avg into Postgres via `formatted_read_group` (Odoo 19+) or `read_group` (16-18). |
| Chatter integration | `chatter_post` adds messages to any `mail.thread` record under the same approval-token gate as writes — or directly via `MCP_CHATTER_DIRECT=1`. |
| Locale plumbing | `ODOO_LOCALE` injects `context.lang` automatically on every Odoo call (caller can override). |
| Structured logging | JSON formatter and rotating file handler via `ODOO_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`, `ODOO_MCP_LOG_JSON`, `ODOO_MCP_LOG_FILE`. |
| Safe writes | Direct `create`, `write`, and `unlink` are blocked; approved writes require live metadata, a same-session token, explicit confirmation, and an env gate. |
| Human-in-the-loop approval | `ODOO_MCP_ELICIT_WRITES=1` shows a native MCP confirmation form (with a diff summary) before any approved write executes — token flow stays as fallback. |
| Audit trail | `ODOO_MCP_AUDIT_LOG` appends one JSONL line per write-path event (preview, validate, execute, chatter) with instance and token digest. |
| Resilience | Read-only calls retry connection errors with exponential backoff; schema caches are TTL- and LRU-bounded; `health_check` flags N+1 read loops. |
| Real smoke tests | Docker Compose validation boots disposable Odoo 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, and 19.0 stacks, including restricted users, custom record rules, and packaged addon XML install/update. |

## Why Odoo MCP

| Trait | Odoo MCP | Other MCP-Odoo bridges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup steps on Odoo side | **0** — works with any Odoo 16+ instance using credentials you already have. | Often require installing an App Store module, configuring enabled models, and granting per-tool permissions. |
| Safe write workflow | Approval token + live `fields_get` validation + explicit confirm + env gate. | Often expose direct `create`/`write`/`unlink` or a "yolo" bypass. |
| Diagnostics | `diagnose_odoo_call`, `diagnose_access`, `inspect_model_relationships`, `upgrade_risk_report`, `fit_gap_report`, `business_pack_report`, `scan_addons_source`. | Usually CRUD only. |
| Transport | XML-RPC (16+) **and** External JSON-2 (Odoo 19+). Ready for the Odoo 22 XML-RPC removal years early. | Usually XML-RPC only — deprecated since Odoo 19, removed in Odoo 22. |
| Migration helpers | `generate_json2_payload` previews the JSON-2 body for any XML-RPC call before you migrate. | None. |
| Multi-instance | Named instances in one config file, per-tool routing, tokens and caches isolated per instance. | Usually one global connection per server process. |
| Agent prompts | 5 ready-made prompts for diagnose / fit-gap / JSON-2 migration / safe-write / module-audit. | Usually none. |
| HTTP transport security | DNS-rebinding protection, host/origin allowlists, local-bind by default. | Often missing. |
| Real Odoo smoke tests | Docker Compose harness boots disposable Odoo 16/17/18/19 stacks per release. | Often mock-based only. |
| Framework examples | Copy-paste adapters for Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Agents, LangGraph, CrewAI, and n8n in [`examples/`](./examples/). | None. |
| Audit & approval UX | JSONL audit trail + native elicitation confirm forms — without installing anything in Odoo. | Audit features usually require an Odoo-side module. |

## Setup

Two paths to a working server: set it up yourself, or paste one prompt and let your coding agent do it for you.

### For humans

The fastest path is the interactive wizard via `uvx`, which fetches the package on demand:

```bash
uvx odoo-mcp --setup
```

The wizard asks for your Odoo URL, database, and credentials, tests the connection live, writes the config file, and prints ready-to-paste snippets for Claude Code, Cursor, and Claude Desktop. Prefer a quick smoke check instead? `uvx odoo-mcp --health`.

Using Claude Desktop on macOS? It reads MCP configuration from:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Use an absolute Python path because GUI apps may not inherit your shell `PATH`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "odoo": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/python3",
      "args": ["-m", "odoo_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ODOO_URL": "https://your-odoo-instance.com",
        "ODOO_DB": "your-database",
        "ODOO_USERNAME": "your-user",
        "ODOO_PASSWORD": "your-password-or-api-key",
        "ODOO_TRANSPORT": "xmlrpc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

More client configs (Windsurf, VS Code, Zed, Continue.dev, Streamable HTTP) are in [docs/client-configs.md](./docs/client-configs.md).

Other ways to install:

```bash
pip install odoo-mcp
# or: pipx install odoo-mcp
```

Prefer a container? See [Docker](#docker). For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuanle96/mcp-odoo.git
cd mcp-odoo
uv sync --extra dev
```

### For AI agents

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or any coding agent and it will install the server for you:

```text
Install the odoo-mcp MCP server (https://github.com/tuanle96/mcp-odoo) in this environment:

1. Ask me for my Odoo URL, database name, username, and password or API key.
   Treat them as secrets: never echo, print, or log these values.
2. Register the server as a stdio MCP server:
   - Claude Code: claude mcp add odoo --env ODOO_URL=<url> --env ODOO_DB=<db>
     --env ODOO_USERNAME=<user> --env ODOO_PASSWORD=<secret> -- uvx odoo-mcp
   - Any other client: write the equivalent config with "command": "uvx",
     "args": ["odoo-mcp"], and the same four env vars.
3. Verify the install: run `uvx odoo-mcp --health`, then call the health_check
   MCP tool and confirm the Odoo connection is reachable.
4. Leave writes disabled (do not set ODOO_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES) unless I
   explicitly ask you to enable them.

Full machine-readable instructions: https://github.com/tuanle96/mcp-odoo/blob/main/llms-install.md
```

Already know your client? One-liners and config snippets:

```bash
claude mcp add odoo --env ODOO_URL=https://mycompany.odoo.com --env ODOO_DB=mycompany \
  --env ODOO_USERNAME=agent@mycompany.com --env ODOO_PASSWORD=your-api-key -- uvx odoo-mcp
```

#### Framework SDKs

Copy-paste-runnable integrations live in [`examples/`](./examples/):

| Client | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor | [`examples/cursor/`](./examples/cursor/) — `.cursor/mcp.json` + agent rules |
| Claude Code / Codex CLI | snippets in [`examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md) |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | [`examples/openai-agents/`](./examples/openai-agents/) — local + hosted variants |
| LangGraph | [`examples/langgraph/`](./examples/langgraph/) — `langchain-mcp-adapters` |
| CrewAI | [`examples/crewai/`](./examples/crewai/) — native `mcps=[...]` agent |
| n8n | [`examples/n8n/`](./examples/n8n/) — importable workflow JSON |

## Configuration reference

Set connection values in the environment:

```bash
export ODOO_URL="https://your-odoo-instance.com"
export ODOO_DB="your-database"
export ODOO_USERNAME="your-user"
export ODOO_PASSWORD="your-password-or-api-key"
export ODOO_TRANSPORT="xmlrpc"
```

For Odoo 19 JSON-2:

```bash
export ODOO_TRANSPORT="json2"
export ODOO_API_KEY="your-odoo-api-key"
export ODOO_JSON2_DATABASE_HEADER="1"
```

`ODOO_JSON2_DATABASE_HEADER=1` sends `X-Odoo-Database` on JSON-2 calls. Set it to `0` only when host or dbfilter routing already selects the intended database.

Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ODOO_CONFIG_FILE` | unset | Explicit path to a config file, checked before the standard locations. |
| `ODOO_LOCALE` | unset | Inject `context.lang` on every Odoo call. Caller-supplied `context.lang` always wins. |
| `ODOO_MCP_MAX_SMART_FIELDS` | `15` | Cap for smart-field selection when caller omits `fields`. |
| `ODOO_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Process logger level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL). |
| `ODOO_MCP_LOG_JSON` | `0` | Truthy → emit JSON-formatted log lines. |
| `ODOO_MCP_LOG_FILE` | unset | Path → enable rotating file handler (10MB × 3 backups). |
| `ODOO_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES` | `0` | Required for `execute_approved_write`. |
| `ODOO_MCP_ALLOWED_SIDE_EFFECT_METHODS` | empty | Exact `model.method` allowlist (e.g. `sale.order.action_confirm`). |
| `ODOO_MCP_POLICY_FILE` | `./odoo_mcp_policy.json` if present | Version-controllable side-effect allowlist with review metadata (see `odoo_mcp_policy.json.example`); merged with the env allowlist. |
| `ODOO_MCP_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_METHODS` | `0` | Broad mode for `execute_method`. Prefer the exact allowlist above. |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUDIT_LOG` | unset | Path → append one JSONL line per write-path event (preview/validate/execute/chatter), tokens stored as digests. |
| `ODOO_MCP_ELICIT_WRITES` | `0` | Truthy → `execute_approved_write` asks the human via MCP elicitation (native confirm form with a diff summary) before executing; falls back to the token flow when the client cannot elicit. |
| `ODOO_MCP_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | `2` | Extra attempts for read-only calls on connection errors (0–5). Writes never retry. |
| `ODOO_MCP_RETRY_BACKOFF` | `0.5` | Base retry backoff seconds; doubles per retry. |
| `ODOO_MCP_SCHEMA_CACHE_TTL` | `600` | Schema cache entry lifetime in seconds. |
| `ODOO_MCP_SCHEMA_CACHE_MAX` | `256` | Max schema cache entries (LRU eviction). |
| `ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MODE` | `off` | `warn` tracks per-`instance:tool` call rates in `health_check`; `block` refuses over-budget calls on the hot read tools and `execute_method`. |
| `ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | `60` | Sliding window length in seconds for rate tracking. |
| `ODOO_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CALLS` | `120` | Calls allowed per window per `instance:tool`. |
| `ODOO_MCP_ASYNC_MAX_WORKERS` | `2` | Worker threads for `submit_async_task`. |
| `ODOO_MCP_ASYNC_MAX_TASKS` | `50` | Max retained background tasks (finished tasks evicted oldest-first). |
| `ODOO_MCP_ASYNC_RESULT_TTL` | `3600` | Seconds a finished background task result stays pollable. |
| `ODOO_MCP_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_DOCS` | `5000` | Total documents allowed across all local BM25 knowledge indexes. |
| `ODOO_MCP_FIELD_POLICY_FILE` | shared policy file | Field ACL policy (a `field_acl` key in the policy file, or a dedicated file here). Denied fields are removed from every read path. See [docs/field-acl.md](docs/field-acl.md). |
| `ODOO_MCP_CROSS_INSTANCE_WORKERS` | `4` | Bounded concurrency for cross-instance fan-out tools. |
| `MCP_CHATTER_DIRECT` | `0` | Truthy → `chatter_post` skips the approval token gate and posts immediately. |
| `MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE_HTTP` | `0` | Truthy → permit non-local HTTP binds (still requires external auth/TLS). |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | local | CSV allowlists for HTTP transports. |
| `ODOO_MCP_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` | `1048576` | Download cap for `read_attachment` content (hard cap 16 MiB). |
| `ODOO_MCP_ATTACHMENT_UPLOAD_ROOTS` | unset | Colon-separated local directories `validate_write` may read `<field>_from_path` uploads from (mirrors `ODOO_ADDONS_PATHS`). Required — fails closed with no roots configured. |
| `ODOO_MCP_MAX_ATTACHMENT_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `10485760` | Size cap for `<field>_from_path` local-file uploads (hard cap 16 MiB). |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_ISSUER_URL` | unset | OAuth 2.1: authorization server issuer. With the two vars below, the HTTP transport becomes a protected resource server (RFC 9728 metadata + bearer validation). |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_INTROSPECTION_URL` | unset | RFC 7662 token introspection endpoint of the authorization server. |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_RESOURCE_URL` | unset | Canonical URL of this MCP server (RFC 8707 audience check when the AS binds tokens). |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_REQUIRED_SCOPES` | empty | CSV scopes required on every request. |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | Credentials for the introspection call when the AS requires client auth. |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_REQUIRE_AUD` | `0` | Truthy → reject tokens whose introspection response has no `aud` claim (default only checks `aud` when present). |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_REQUIRE_ISS` | `0` | Truthy → reject introspection responses without an `iss` claim. A present `iss` must always match `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_ISSUER_URL` (mix-up attack hardening). |
| `ODOO_MCP_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` | `60` | Seconds to cache introspection verdicts (`0` disables). Bounds both AS load and revocation lag. |
| `ODOO_MCP_PLUGINS` | unset | CSV entry-point names to load as third-party tool plugins (group `odoo_mcp.tools`). Installation alone activates nothing; failures are isolated and reported in `health_check`. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md). |
| `ODOO_MCP_TOOLS_INCLUDE` / `_EXCLUDE` | unset | CSV fnmatch globs trimming the registered tool surface per deployment (small agents drown in 41 tools). Removed names listed in `health_check`. |
| `ODOO_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` | unset | Plain-text file appended to the server-level MCP `instructions` every client receives — deployment-specific guidance (fiscal-year rules, naming conventions) without touching tool descriptions. |

You can also use `odoo_config.json`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-odoo-instance.com",
  "db": "your-database",
  "username": "your-user",
  "password": "your-password-or-api-key"
}
```

### Multiple Odoo instances

One server can talk to several Odoo databases. Add an `instances` map to your config file (auto-detected — a file without `instances` keeps the flat single-instance shape above):

```json
{
  "default": "acme",
  "instances": {
    "acme": {
      "url": "https://acme.odoo.com",
      "db": "acme",
      "username": "bot",
      "api_key": "...",
      "transport": "json2"
    },
    "globex": {
      "url": "https://globex.odoo.com",
      "db": "globex",
      "username": "bot",
      "password": "...",
      "lang": "fr_FR",
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

- Every read/write tool accepts an optional `instance` parameter; omitted → the `default` instance. `default` itself is optional when only one instance is defined.
- Each entry supports the same keys as the flat config (`url`, `db`, `username`, `password`, `api_key`, `transport`, `json2_database_header`, `lang`) plus `timeout` and `verify_ssl`. Instance entries are self-contained: credentials and transport never fall back to env vars (so one instance can never inherit another deployment's `ODOO_API_KEY`). Only non-credential knobs (`ODOO_TIMEOUT`, `ODOO_VERIFY_SSL`, `ODOO_LOCALE`) act as fallback defaults for entries that omit them. Env overrides like `ODOO_TRANSPORT`/`ODOO_API_KEY` still apply to legacy flat configs, as before.
- `ODOO_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.json` points at an explicit config file, checked before `./odoo_config.json`, `~/.config/odoo/config.json`, and `~/.odoo_config.json`.
- **Precedence**: when `ODOO_URL`/`ODOO_DB`/`ODOO_USERNAME`/`ODOO_PASSWORD` are all set, the environment wins and defines a single instance named `default` — unset them to use a multi-instance file.
- Instance names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`. Clients connect lazily — an instance is only contacted when a tool targets it.
- Discovery: the `list_instances` tool returns configured names, URLs, databases, and transports — never credentials.
- Write-approval tokens encode the instance name, so a token validated against one instance can never execute on another.
- MCP resources (`odoo://…`) always use the default instance in this release; use tools for multi-instance access.

## Run

Start the MCP server over stdio:

```bash
odoo-mcp
```

or:

```bash
python -m odoo_mcp
```

Start Streamable HTTP for local clients:

```bash
odoo-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --path /mcp
```

Non-local HTTP binds are rejected unless you pass `--allow-remote-http` or set `MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE_HTTP=1`. This server does not include built-in HTTP authentication. Put remote HTTP deployments behind your own authentication, TLS, and network policy.

Check runtime posture without starting the server loop:

```bash
odoo-mcp --health
```

## MCP Tools

41 tools grouped by use case. Each tool name is a single-purpose handle the agent can call. Tools that talk to Odoo accept an optional `instance` parameter when multiple instances are configured (see [Multiple Odoo instances](#multiple-odoo-instances)).

### Accounting (2)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `receivable_payable_aging` | Aged AR/AP report bucketed by days overdue (not due / 1-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+), with per-partner totals. |
| `accounting_health_summary` | Open receivable/payable item counts plus the draft invoice backlog. |

### Background tasks (4)

One question across many configured instances, merged and attributed. See the [partner playbook](docs/partner-playbook.md).

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_across_instances` | Search every opted-in instance (or a list/tag selection); rows tagged with `_instance`, partial results on per-instance failure. |
| `aggregate_across_instances` | Group/aggregate per instance plus additive grand totals across the fleet. |
| `accounting_health_across_instances` | AR/AP aging across every client DB with combined buckets — the partner-network sweep. |

### Utility (2)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `health_check` | Report non-secret MCP runtime posture, including rate-limit counters and field-ACL status when enabled. |
| `list_instances` | List configured Odoo instance names, URLs, databases, transports, and cross-instance tags — never credentials. |

## Resources

| URI | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `odoo://models` | List available models. |
| `odoo://model/{model_name}` | Read model metadata and fields. |
| `odoo://record/{model_name}/{record_id}` | Read one record. |
| `odoo://search/{model_name}/{domain}` | Search records with a bounded domain. |

## Prompts

11 prompts: 5 diagnostic, plus 6 operational **workflow** prompts that encode end-to-end business processes and route every write through the approval gate.

| Prompt | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `diagnose_failed_odoo_call` | Root-cause a failing Odoo call before retrying. |
| `fit_gap_workshop` | Turn raw requirements into Odoo fit/gap buckets. |
| `json2_migration_plan` | Plan XML-RPC or JSON-RPC migration to External JSON-2. |
| `safe_write_review` | Review a proposed `create`, `write`, or `unlink`. |
| `custom_module_audit` | Audit local addon source with scan, risk, and business evidence. |
| `invoice_approval_chain` | Triage draft invoices and post each through the write gate with human checkpoints. |
| `po_to_receipt` | Three-way match a purchase order against receipt and bill; flags discrepancies (read-only). |
| `customer_onboarding` | Dedup-check, then gated-create a customer with contacts and payment terms. |
| `expense_claim_review` | Policy-check pending expense claims, then gated approve/refuse. |
| `accounting_close_checklist` | Read-only month-end checklist: aging, unreconciled items, draft backlog. |

## Safe Write Model

Writes are intentionally boring.

1. `preview_write` creates a canonical, non-executing payload.
2. `validate_write` checks model metadata, required fields, readonly fields, relation hints, record IDs, and payload shape.
3. `execute_approved_write` runs only when all gates pass:
   - the approval came from `validate_write` in the same server process,
   - validation used trusted, non-empty live Odoo `fields_get` metadata,
   - the token has not expired or been consumed,
   - `confirm=true` is passed,
   - `ODOO_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=1` is set.

Odoo access rules, record rules, and server-side constraints still decide the final result.

Batch creates go through the same gates: pass `values_list` (one dict per
record, max 100) to `preview_write`/`validate_write` — execution maps to a
single atomic Odoo `create(vals_list)` call. Per-record differing `write`
values are deliberately unsupported (they would need one non-atomic RPC per
record). Optional extras: `ODOO_MCP_ELICIT_WRITES=1` adds a native
human-confirmation form, `ODOO_MCP_AUDIT_LOG` records every write-path event.

Large binary fields (a resume attached to `ir.attachment.datas`, a product
image, ...) don't have to be inlined as base64 in the tool call — pass
`<field>_from_path` instead (e.g. `datas_from_path: "/local/path/cv.pdf"`) to
`validate_write`. The server reads the file itself; the approval only ever
carries a `sha256:<hex>:<size>` fingerprint for that field, never the real
content, so nothing large has to round-trip through the calling agent's
context. Requires `ODOO_MCP_ATTACHMENT_UPLOAD_ROOTS` (fails closed otherwise)
and respects `ODOO_MCP_MAX_ATTACHMENT_UPLOAD_BYTES`. No new tool — this rides
the same `preview_write` → `validate_write` → `execute_approved_write` gate as
every other write.

Reviewed side-effect methods such as `sale.order.action_confirm` can be enabled
one by one:

```bash
export ODOO_MCP_ALLOWED_SIDE_EFFECT_METHODS="sale.order.action_confirm,res.partner.message_post"
```

`ODOO_MCP_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_METHODS=1` is still supported for trusted deployments,
but `health_check` reports it as broad mode. Prefer exact allowlist entries when
you only need a small number of reviewed methods.

## Docker

Use the prebuilt GHCR image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tuanle96/mcp-odoo:latest
```

Or build it locally:

```bash
docker build -t mcp/odoo:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

Run over stdio from an MCP client (replace `mcp/odoo:latest` with `ghcr.io/tuanle96/mcp-odoo:latest` to use the prebuilt image):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "odoo": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "ODOO_URL",
        "-e", "ODOO_DB",
        "-e", "ODOO_USERNAME",
        "-e", "ODOO_PASSWORD",
        "-e", "ODOO_TRANSPORT",
        "-e", "ODOO_API_KEY",
        "mcp/odoo:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Run Streamable HTTP locally:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  -e ODOO_URL \
  -e ODOO_DB \
  -e ODOO_USERNAME \
  -e ODOO_PASSWORD \
  -e ODOO_TRANSPORT \
  -e ODOO_API_KEY \
  mcp/odoo:latest \
  --transport streamable-http \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8000 \
  --allow-remote-http
```

## Test

Run the normal quality gates:

```bash
uv run python -m ruff check .
uv run python -m mypy src
uv run python -m pytest
```

Run real Odoo smoke tests:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --with-editable . scripts/odoo_compose_smoke.py \
  --versions 16.0 17.0 18.0 19.0 \
  --timeout 360 \
  --inspector-smoke
```

The smoke harness boots disposable Docker Compose stacks, validates direct Odoo access, validates MCP stdio, and for Odoo 19 also validates JSON-2 and Streamable HTTP.

Run the multi-instance smoke (one stack, three databases, two accounts on one instance):

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --with-editable . scripts/odoo_multi_instance_smoke.py
```

## Compatibility

XML-RPC remains the default transport for broad compatibility. Odoo 19 supports External JSON-2 through `ODOO_TRANSPORT=json2`. XML-RPC and JSON-RPC are deprecated since Odoo 19 and scheduled for removal in Odoo 22 (fall 2028), so new integrations should plan for JSON-2.
